        <p>Web Developer with experience in the Entertainment Industry. After taking 
            a career break saw the opportunity to refresh skills by attending
            a FullStack Bootcamp. Here you'll find some the the projects I am most
            proud of. For now, they are mostly all about HTML and CSS. Have also 
            been using GitHub for repositories and deployment of my projects.
